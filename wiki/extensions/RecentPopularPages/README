This is a simple MediaWiki extension created specifically for the UESP.net wiki to display a list of
wiki pages sorted by number of page views in the last few days or weeks. It has been tested on MW 1.27
but should work in a range of versions.

This extension has 2 main components:
 1. MediaWiki Extension for displaying page view data.
 2. PHP script for parsing page view data from access logs and saving to database.
 
 Basic features include:
  - Display of page views sorted by most to least.
  - View data from the last day/week/month/year.
  - Display page views or summaries including by namespace, domain, or other.
  - Basic filtering of results by name.


== Installation ==
 1. Copy the extension into your MediaWiki "extensions/RecentPopularPages/" directory.
 2. Add the following line to your LocalSettings.php file:
       require_once( "$IP/extensions/RecentPopularPages/RecentPopularPages.php");
 3. Run the update.php script for your wiki:
       php maintenance/update.php
 4. Setup a source of page view data (see below).


== Page View Data ==
A source of page view data has to be setup in order for the extension to have data to display. The current
version includes a PHP script for parsing Varnish access logs for the UESP.net. This script will have to be
modified for your access log format, database access, and site setup.

A basic setup involves the following:

 1. Turn on logging in your Apache/Squid/Varnish/Lighttpd/Nginx/... web server. The UESP uses a Varnish cache
    as the main web access so we parse access logs from there. Any log format can be used but an Apache log 
    compatible format will be easiest.
 2. Copy or modify the scripts/popularPageCounts-parseVarnishLog.php script. The following items may need to 
    be changed:
        - Wiki database host, user, password, and name
        - HOST_REGEX
        - ACCESS_LOG_DATEFORMAT
        - ACCESS_LOG_REGEX
        - Access log location
        - Location to save raw count data (or disable if not needed).
 3. Add modified script to /etc/cron.hourly/ or /etc/cron.daily/ to execute automatically as desired.


== Notes ==
 - The log parsing script is re-entrant meaning it can parse the same log multiple times and it will only
   add newer log entries. It saves the last parsed log timestamp in the popularPageInfo table. If you wish
   to reset your log parsing this table needs to be cleared along with popularPageCounts and popularPageSummaries.
 - Pages with a small number of views (< 5) are not saved to keep the database tables smaller for busy wikis.
   This can be modified by the MIN_COUNT_FOR_DATABASE member in the parsing script.
 - Currently there is no mechanism to delete old data from the popularPageCounts table meaning it may 
   get abnormally large for busy wikis.
 - Page views are currently group by day. Depending on how you parse your logs you may get small numbers
   for your 1 day page view counts as it will be a partial count.
