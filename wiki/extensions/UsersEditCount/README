Extension: User Edit Count
Author: Daveh, dave@uesp.net, https://en.uesp.net/wiki/User:Daveh

This directory contains the "Users Edit Count" extension, converted into a standard Mediawiki
extension.  It is an independent extension that does not require any customizations
to the core Medawiki files.

It will work with Mediawiki 1.25+ (tested up to 1.27)

==Installation==
For a fresh installation of the extension, you need to:
(a) place the files in this directory into $IP/extensions/UsersEditCount
(b) add the following line to LocalSettings.php:

wfLoadExtension('UsersEditCount.php');

To check that the extension is working:
* View [[Special:SpecialPages]] and confirm that "Users Edit Count" is listed
  (under "Users and rights" on newer wiki code)
* View [[Special:UsersEditCount]] and confirm that a valid page appears
