This directory contains the "Users Edit Count" extension, converted into a standard Mediawiki
extension.  It is an independent extension that does not require any customizations
to the core Medawiki files.

It will work with Mediawiki 1.10 or 1.14

==Installation==
For a fresh installation of the extension, you need to:
(a) place the files in this directory into $IP/extensions/UsersEditCount
(b) add the following line to LocalSettings.php:
require_once( $IP . '/extensions/UsersEditCount/UsersEditCount.php' );

To check that the extension is working:
* View [[Special:SpecialPages]] and confirm that "Users Edit Count" is listed
  (under "Users and rights" on newer wiki code)
* View [[Special:UsersEditCount]] and confirm that a valid page appears

==Upgrading==
If this is replacing an old version of the extension (i.e., a version that was not set up as a standalone
Mediawiki extension), then you simply need to place these new files into $IP/w/extensions/UsersEditCount, 
overwriting the existing UsersEditCount.php file.

The LocalSettings.php file does not need to be edited.

To confirm that the new version of the extension is being used, you can:
* Check the [[Special:UsersEditCount]] page.  The line "The following is a list of all registered
  editors on UESPWiki, sorted by total edit count." should now appear at the top of the page.
* Check the [[Special:Version]] page.  ActiveUsers should now be listed under Special Pages

Once you're confident it is working, old sections of code can be removed from the
standard mediawiki directories:
* delete $IP/w/SpecialActiveUsers.php
* delete $IP/w/SpecialPage.php  (the version in w, rather than w/includes, is a copy of SpecialPage.php in a non-standard location)
* delete $IP/w/includes/SpecialActiveUsers.php
* restore original $IP/w/includes/QueryPage.php
* restore original $IP/w/includes/SpecialPage.php
* restore original $IP/w/languages/messages/MessagesEn.php

Also, the documentation at [[UESPWiki:Active Users]] probably needs to be revamped.
