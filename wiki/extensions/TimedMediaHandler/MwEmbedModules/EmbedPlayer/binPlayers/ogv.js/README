Source & credits for ogv.js wrapper: https://github.com/brion/ogv.js

Contains libogg, libvorbis, libtheora, and libopus -- see COPYING-*.txt


ogv.js contains the OgvJsPlayer wrapper class and some dependencies.
The low-level codec payload lives in ogv-codec.js and is loaded on demand.

Highly recommended to enable gzip compression on the web server for .js files,
as it cuts the transfer size down for the codec down to about 1/4.

dynamicaudio.swf is a thin linear PCM audio output shim used by ogv.js when the
W3C Web Audio API is not available, as on IE 10/11.
