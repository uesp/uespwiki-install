DailyEdits is a very basic MediaWiki extension that displays a table/graph of the edits made to the wiki
on a per-day basis. It was specifically created for the UESP.net wiki and while installation else where is
not exactly supported the basic installation is given below.

For more information about this extension contact Dave Humphrey at dave@uesp.net

INSTALLATION

1. Install extension like a typical MediaWiki extension.
2. Install gnuplot (yum install gnuplot or similar command).
3. Set the $wgDailyEditsGraphFile config global in LocalSettings.php to a URL where the daily graph file 
   can be accessed publically. For example:
        $wgDailyEditsGraphFile = "//content3.uesp.net/w/extensions/UespCustomCode/files/dailyedits.png";
4. Copy the scripts/uesp-create-dailyedits-plot to /etc/cron.daily or some place where it will be run daily.
5. Edit the uesp-create-dailyedits-plot script according to your setup:
      - Data File Output (/tmp/dailyedits.dat)
      - MySQL Access
      - Wiki Database name
      - Location of the dailyedits-plot.cfg file
6. Edit the scripts/dailyedits-plot.cfg according to your setup:
      - Location of the dailyedits.dat file
      - Output location of the dailyedits.png graph file
7. You can run the uesp-create-dailyedits-plot script manually to debug until it runs without errors.
8. Test the Special:DailyEdits page of your wiki to ensure the table and graph shows up.


USAGE

Simply visit the https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Special:DailyEdits page of your wiki to view the table and graph
once configured.

Click the "Date" or "Edit Count" table headers to sort by that column.

You can view the data in CSV format by appending "csv=1" to the page URL, for example:
