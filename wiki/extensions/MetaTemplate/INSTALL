==Installation==
#1 Move directory to $IP/extensions/MetaTemplate
   * changes that take effect: none

#2 Run Install.php
   * changes that take effect: none that are visible

   Sets up two new database tables that are used by the #save and #load functions
   * It does not make any changes to existing wiki tables, and therefore has no risk of side effects to standard
     wiki functions.  The actual SQL that gets executed (before wiki-related processing to turn into true SQL)
     can be seen in install.sql
   It must be run from the command line (e.g., 'php Install.php')
   It only needs to be once when extension is first installed (and only needs to be done on one content server, not all)


#3 Add the following line to LocalSettings.php

require_once( \$IP . '/extensions/MetaTemplate/MetaTemplate.php' );

  * changes that take effect: extension is now fully enabled
    * The only immediate visible change should be the addition of MetaTemplate to Special:Version
    * All of the other extension features are only only implemented if explicitly requested (if the
      extension's tags/functions are used in articles are templates).  Since the features have not
      yet been implemented, activating the extension will not cause any changes to current articles.
    * Once the extension is available, it will become possible to set up test templates using the
      features.

Notes:
This extension also requires a bug fix to Parser.php, but that bug fix has already been incorporated into
the version of Parser.php used with UespCustomCode.  Therefore, no Mediawiki code changes are necessary
for this extension.

==Upgrading Mediawiki==
As of v0.4 of the extension, it has been revamped to be compatible with the latest version of Mediawiki.

However, making it work with current Mediawiki versions requires changes to two Mediawiki files, Parser.php
and Preprocessor_Hash.php.  Versions of these files derived from a Mediawiki 1.15alpha (i.e., non-released)
version of the code have been placed in mw15_modified (Parser.php also requires the code modifications
necessary for UespCustomCode).  Slightly different versions of these files are likely to be necessary
depending upon the version of Mediawiki that is installed on UESP -- I'll be putting together a patch
file that can simply be applied to any set of code.  Also, I'll be trying to get these changes added to
the base Mediawiki code, in which case no patch file would even be necessary.

Other than these two Mediawiki files that need updating, no other changes should be necessary to the
extension when upgrading Mediawiki.
