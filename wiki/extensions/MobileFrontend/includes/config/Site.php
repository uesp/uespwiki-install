 * mobile URL. To statically create it, just set $wgMobileUrlTemplate to
 * the static hostname. For example:
 *		$wgMobileUrlTemplate = "mobile.mydomain.com";

 * parts of the 'host' section of a URL. The placeholders are denoted by '%h'
 * and followed with a digit that maps to the position of a host-part of the
 * original, non-mobile URL. Take the host 'en.wikipedia.org' for example.
 * '%h0' maps to 'en', '%h1' maps to 'wikipedia', and '%h2' maps to 'org'.
 * So, if you wanted a mobile URL scheme that turned "en.wikipedia.org" into
 * "en.m.wikipedia.org", your URL template would look like:
